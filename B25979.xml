            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>VPon the observation of what persons were prohibited ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to the Temple, lest they should defile it, two things methodically do come to hand to be considered thereupon, as referring to it; and those are, 1. What course was taken for the prohibiting of the unclean from coming there. And 2. What was the penalty of those that were in their uncleannesse, yet would dare to come.</p>
                  <p>The former inquiry is not of so easy resolution as is the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the reason is, because thousands of persons might come, that were not in a fit case to have come thither; and yet it was impossible, without immodesty and uncivility, unless it were by oath, to discover in what case they were. There were indeed Porters &amp; guards at the gates, but thousands of unclean persons might pass them, and they never the wiser, unless they should have put the passengers to an oath, which I beleeve was never yet dreamed of by any writer that hath handled the Jews customs. Men in issues of blood or seed, and women in their ordinary or extraordinary fluxes, could neither be discerned by their face in what case they were, nor do we find that they were ever at all examined, much lesse sworn or searched. They might repel and keep back, indeed, what or whosoever carried with them visible defiling, as one that appeared to be a Leper, one that came with things about him that might not be brought into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: or they might keep back those that would go beyond their bounds: or they might have an eye to any that came suspiciously either to steal or to disturb the service: or they might check those that shewed any lightnesse at their coming in, or being entred: or they might direct those that were not well acquainted with the place what to do &amp; how to behave themselves there: or they might admonish all that came, to take heed of coming there if they were unclean: But as for keeping out all that were in any uncleanness, and such as whereby the place might receive defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was a thing so far impossible, that it is far from being imaginable. A man might have touched a dead corps, or might have touched a woman in her separation, or suffered gonorrhoea in the night, or twenty such like cases as these, and he cometh
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:178179:8"/> to enter into the Temple, and no one in the world knew how the case was with him but himself, how should this man be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly discovered or restrained, unless it were by the spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie, or by giving him an oath, which power we never read the Porters to have had, nor is there any ground or colour to suppose such a thing.</p>
                  <p>The security of the place therefore from such pollutions lay more in the severity of the penalties that were sentenced against and inflicted upon those that were deprehended offenders in this kind, then it did in any possible care, or practicall preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they could use that they should not come there: And as the rigour and strictness of Laws, and execution upon offenders in other cases, is the surest prevention of such offences, the like was the way of caution and prevention here.</p>

And the Jews do ever account <hi>Cutting off</hi> to be the higher and more eminent degree of divine vengeance: As to spare more eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this, which might be given copiously, this passage of <hi>Maymonides</hi> is sufficient, and it is remarkable, when he saith<note n="[f]" place="margin">Maym. in Biath.

                  <p>By <hi>Death by the hand of Heaven</hi> in their sense therefore is to be apprehended some such a sodain avengefull stroke, as the Lord shewed upon <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> or <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to take them away. And this may the better be collected by two passages usuall in the Rabbines about this matter: First, in that they give up the offence of the Priests drinking wine before they went to serve, [which is held to have been the offence of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu;</hi>]<note n="[g]" place="margin">Id b. per. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <p>This then was the sure guard of the Temple, that kept it from defilement and pollution: the dreadfull penalties that were sure to light upon those that were discovered to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and to know so much, and yet to have dared to enter there: Nay he that knew not of his uncleanness, if he came in there, was not so intirely excused by this his ignorance, but that whensoever he came to know in what case hee was, he was bound to bring an offering for this his sin, and so was he to do in the other cases [whose witting and wilful committing them, deserved <hi>cutting off</hi>] if he did any of them unwillingly and not knowing: Did he eat fat or blood, and not know what he eat, or come into the Sanctuary in uncleanness, and not know that he was unclean, or commit any of the other transgressions mentioned, and not know that he transgressed, there was an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering appointed to atone for him, which he was to bring as soon as he came to know that he had misdon: but he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and wilfully would run into those faults, there was no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to atone for him, but hee fell under the indignation of God; and liableness to divine vengeance, and humane penalty, and expectation when it would seiz upon him: And to this the Apostle writing to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> who were very well acquainted with these things, seemeth to allude in those words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.11. <hi>If we sin wilfully after wee have received the knowledg of the truth, there is no more sacrifice for sin, but a certain fearfull looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10.26, 27.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:178179:17"/> the Sanctuary, but their father <hi>Eli</hi> was High-priest; so in the beginning of <hi>Davids</hi> settlement in his Kingdome, <hi>Abiathar</hi> was chief Priest, and he was of the house of <hi>Ithamar;</hi> now the High-priest did not so much attend the ordinary and common service of the Sanctuary; therefore <hi>Zadok</hi> of <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Ahimelech</hi> of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> were the chief in that service under him.</p>

                  <p>AS soon as <hi>Solomon</hi> was set upon the throne, hee put <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the High-priesthood, as a man guilty of treason in the conspiracy of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and he put in <hi>Zadok</hi> in his room, and now <hi>Eleazars</hi> line hath the High-priesthood again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zadoks</hi> son was <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.36. his son <hi>Azariah,</hi> and his son <hi>Iohanan,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.9. These six are omitted by <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> in his reckoning up of the line of the High-priests, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. and the reason of the omission we may guesse to bee, because from the time of <hi>Amariah</hi> the house of <hi>Eli</hi> began in the function, and till the time of <hi>Azariah</hi> the son of <hi>Iohanan</hi> the service in the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> did not begin.</p>
                  <p>The son of <hi>Iohanan</hi> was <hi>Azariah. He it was that executed the Priests office in the Temple which</hi> Solomon <hi>built in</hi> Jerusalem, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.10. But the question is, What time it was when he executed this office, whether at the beginning of the temple ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when it was new built, or in aftertimes? The Jews doe very generally hold, that this <hi>Azariah</hi> was hee that withstood <hi>Ʋzziah</hi> when hee went into the Temple to burn incense, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.17.21. And because he stood so gallantly for the honour of the Priesthood against the King, that therefore it is said of him alone, that <hi>he executed the Priests Office in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Kimchi</hi> goes yet further, holding indeed that this was <hi>Ʋzziahs Azariah,</hi> but that hee was born in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, and so he makes him to live at the least two hundred years, an age not usuall in those times. But by looking over the times of the High-priests that succeeded him to the captivity, it will bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent enough that this <hi>Azariah</hi> the son of <hi>Johanan,</hi> was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:178179:17"/> High-priest in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, and was dead and rotten many a year before <hi>Ʋzziah</hi> was born.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This</hi> Azariah <hi>begat</hi> Amariah, as it is recorded, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.11. Now this <hi>Amariah</hi> was High-priest in the days of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Amariah</hi> begat <hi>Ahitub,</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 6.11. this <hi>Ahitub</hi> was <hi>Iehojada,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 23.1. &amp;c. and he is called <hi>Ahitub the Ruler of the house of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Neh.</hi> 11.11. because of his great power and sway in the crowning of <hi>Ioash,</hi> and in the work of Reformation.</p>

                     <hi>Ahitub</hi> begat <hi>Zadok,</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 6.12. this <hi>Zadok</hi> was father in law to King <hi>Ʋzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 27.1. Now <hi>Zadok</hi> was not <hi>Ahitubs</hi> immediate son, but his grand-child, for <hi>Zadok</hi> was the son of <hi>Merajoth</hi> the son of <hi>Ahitub,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 9.11. which <hi>Merajoth</hi> may wel be supposed to be <hi>Zechariah,</hi> the son of <hi>Iehojadah,</hi> who was sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Temple court, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 24. and named here <hi>Merajoth,</hi> in memoriall of that great rebellion of the people, against God, his Prophet, and his Temple, and omitted in the line of the Priests, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 6. because he was not used like an High-priest, his High-priesthood was not long, and he dyed as a Prophet.</p>

Now because it was the custome to inroll the names of those that were admitted to be Priests, and the names of their parents, they called the mother of <hi>Iesus</hi> to give them account of his parentage, [for <hi>Ioseph</hi> was now dead] and when she had told them that he had no earthly father, but was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and that she bare him, as divers could witnesse which were present at her travail, but that she was yet a virgin: and when they had taken the witness of some that were with her at her child-birth, and had received testimony from other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:178179:27"/> whom they set to search her, that shee was still a virgin, they entred the name and parentage of <hi>Iesus</hi> into their register; in these words, <hi>Such a day such a Priest died, the son of such a man, and such a woman; and by the common suffrage there was chosen in his stead,</hi> Jesus <hi>the son of the living God, and of the virgin</hi> Mary. And this register book [saith this relater] at the sacking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was preserved by the care and industry of some of the chief of the Jews, and is now laid up privately at <hi>Tiberias:</hi> and this story [saith <hi>Suidas</hi>] I had from some that heard it from <hi>Philip;</hi> to whom it was related.</p>
                  <p>Not to insist upon the examination of this story, but to leave it as we found it, and to return to the Courses that wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; It is held by the Jews, and that not without some ground, that of all the four and twenty Courses that served under the first Temple, four only returned out of the captivity of <hi>Babel;</hi> namely <hi>Jedajah, Harim, Pashur, Immer.</hi> Thus the <hi>Jerusalem Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> and <hi>Tosaphoth ad Taanith</hi>

                  <p>But how shall these four families do, to make four and twenty Courses, as was the primitive and originall distribution, and that by prophetick and divine appointment? The Prophets ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that were amongst the children of the captivity [say the same authors] found out a way to cast them into so many Courses, and their way was this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They made four and twenty lots, and they wrote the names of the heads of the four and twenty Courses upon them, and put them into the lottery box.</hi> Jedajah <hi>took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the meaning of this tradition is this: That in drawing these lots with the names of the heads of the old courses upon them, they only intended to find out, what courses of the old names must be made out of every one of these four families, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:178179:27"/> they did not intend to alter the order of the Courses, but to let them run as they did in the ancient round: only the course of <hi>Iojarib</hi> which of old was the first, is now put to give place to <hi>Iedajah.</hi> And the reason of this was because <hi>Iedajah</hi> was of the High-priests family, of the house of <hi>Ioshua</hi> the son of <hi>Iozedek,</hi> and so they allotted him the preheminence, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.36.

                     <hi>in this their new molding, every one was to take his course as his lot was drawn, and that in the order that the lot came up in the drawers hand they served their weeks.</hi> But if this were a reason, why should not <hi>Iojarib</hi> be a drawer of the lots as well as <hi>Jeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> since the record saith he was present? and if they were so indifferent for the altering of the order of the Courses, why should they be so punctuall for their number, since the one in the primitive institution was appointed for divine direction as well as the other? When the Evangelist <hi>Luke</hi> saith that <hi>Zachary</hi> the father of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist was <hi>of the Course of Abia, Luk.</hi> 1.5. he undoubtedly referreth to the order of <hi>Abia's</hi> course as it is ranked in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. For the family of <hi>Abia</hi> was not now extant among the Courses, for there is no mention at all of him among the Priests that returned out of captivity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Evangelist saith, not that <hi>Zachary</hi> was of his family but of his course, that is, of a Course that bare his name: but as for the order of the Course, he either referreth to the Text mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or to a place to be found in scripture, and so his words to be construed and understood by it, or else there is no order of his course to be found at all.</p>

                  <p>The distribution of Porters into four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Courses, is not so clearly legible in the Scripture, as is such a distribution of the Priests and Singers; for the courses of both those, are both numbred and named, and so are not these.

For in the former, the Porters goe in the very same equipage, as to the matter of division into Courses, with the Priests, and Singers. <hi>He appointed the Courses of the Priests, according to the order of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid his Father, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the Lord, as the duty of every day required; the Porters also by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:178179:29"/> their courses et every gate.</hi> And in the latter, the first Fathers of the Porters are summed up to the very same number that the first fathers of the other Courses were, namely, to four &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>Amongst all the Porters</hi>

And our Rabbins have distributed them into four and twenty places, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Office of the Porters was first to open and shut the doors of <hi>the Mountain of the house,</hi> and of the Court of the <hi>Women;</hi> (for we have observed elsewhere, that the Priests tooke care for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening and shutting the Gates of the other Court) and to attend in those Gates all the day for prevention of any inconvenience that might come, to the prejudice of the purity, safety, or peace of the place or service. Secondly, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puts some Treasureship upon the porters, as that they had some Treasures and Treasuries at the Gates where they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; of which is spoken at large in our Treating concerning the Gates and Treasuries elsewhere. As for that part of their office and imployment, which the Rabbins do sometimes make mention of, (under the phrase of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now besides this care of the Porters at the Gates by day, there was as much or more both at the Gates and other places by night in the guards which were see to watch the Temple, which were four and twenty in all.<note n="[d]" place="margin">Maym. in Beth. habbech. per. <hi>8.</hi>

About the wall that enclosed the Courts, there were two guards at the two East corners, and two at the West, and both of them without the wall of the Court: and there were five at five of the seven gates. The two gates that had not the Levites guards upon them, were the <hi>Water gate,</hi> over which there was a guard of Priests in the chamber of <hi>Absines</hi> and the upper gate of <hi>Corban,</hi> by which there was a guard of Priests in the roome <hi>Beth Mokadh.</hi> And there was one guard more of Levites on the North side, in the chamber of <hi>Corban,</hi> over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy place, and another on the South side over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Vaile, and another just behinde the most holy place.

                     <hi>For at every pause</hi> [saith the <hi>Talmud] there was a sounding with the trumpets, and at every sounding there was a worshipping,</hi> their sounding with the trumpets, was, as hath been spoken before, a <hi>Taratantara,</hi> [as we hav chosen to call it,] and they never sounded otherwise then so, when they sounded, namely, three strains, a plain, a quavering and a plain again: and thus did the trumpets sound one and twenty blasts every day; three at the opening of the Court gate, nine at the morning sacrifice, and nine at the evening sacrifice: namely, three soundings at the three pausings of the musick, and the three strains named, at every sounding: and so wee see that the trumpets were never joyned with the Quire in consort, but sounded only when the Quire was silent.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the Song, and these were the Psalms sung ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily throughout all the year: but at some certain dayes there were other Psalms and Songs used, and the trumpets also sounded extraordinary soundings, besides that number now mentioned.</p>

                  <p>Now it was impossible that all <hi>Israel</hi> should be present at the

They would not fast on the first day of the week, because they would not slip out of the joy and delight of a Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fast, and they would not fast on the last day of the week, because they would not preface the joy and delight of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, with a Fast neither.

                  <p>First, they stood to be a representative congregation, in behalf of all the people, at the offering up of the daily sacrifice which was the sacrifice of all the people; and at the use and administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the publick ordinances and service. The Iews were so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and punctual about this point, of having a competent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation present, when the publick ordinances were admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred;<note n="[h]" place="margin">Megillah. per. <hi>4.</hi> Maym. in Tephillah. per. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note> that in their Synagogues they would not have publick prayers, nor reading of the Law, unless ten men were there; much more was there a fitting congregation of the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be at the Temple-service, which concerned all the people, to be administred unto, besides the Priests which were to administer: There was sacrificing there, twice a day, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Law at the least twice, and prayers four times, and it had becomed and behooved [if it had been possible] all the people to have been there present and attending; which because it could not possibly bee done, that all the people should bee constant there, they ordained and provided these Courses of Stationary men, to be as the Deputies of all the people, and a representative Congregation in their behalf. It had been a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contempt of those ordinances, to have had them admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred daily, and none of the people to have been attending on them: and it would have been a hazard, that in time they would have been neglected by the people, if they had been only left to their own liberty, to come, or not to come to them, as they saw good; therefore to prevent this visible contempt that might have accrewed, and to provide that there might bee alwaies a congregation of the people, these <hi>stationary Courses</hi> were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if devotion brought no other of the people to the service, yet these their representatives might be sure to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>A second imployment that they, or at least, some of them
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:178179:37"/> had, was to take care [as representatives of the people] that those of the people that had been under any uncleanness, and being now cleansed were come to have their atonement made, might be dispatched, and the business done for which they came.

                  <p>There have been some who have conceived that these <hi>Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> men, as representatives of the whole congregation, were to lay their hands upon the head of the dayly sacrifice, which was an offering for all the people; I did once go along also with this opinion, but now I find the Jews on the contrary, asserting<note n="[k]" place="margin">Maym. in Corban. per. <hi>3.</hi>

                     <hi>That there was no laying on of hands upon the sacrifices of the whole Congregation, but only in two cases.

                     <hi>As they never made a station at the morning sacrifice all the eight dayes of the feast of Dedication, nor at the evening sacrifice on those dayes, when there was an additionall sacrifice, added to the dayly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>Stationary men</hi> in the week of their attendance, might neither be trimmed by the Barber, nor might they wash their cloaths in all that time: And the reason of this was, because they were to do these things before they entred their attendance, and to come near to it, and not to have these things to do, when they were entred.</p>

                     <hi>He was to sprinkle it out of the vessell, but two sprinklings upon two sides of the Altar, namely, at the North-east corner and at the South-west corner; and he must take care to sprinkle the bloud at the corner, so as that it may go on both the sides of the Altar, like a</hi> Gamma (<hi>thus</hi> Γ,) <hi>so that the bloud at the two sprinklings may be found upon all the foure sides of the Altar.</hi> Their meaning is this, that as he stood on the East side of the Altar, neare to the North-east corner, he must cast the bloud out of the vessell with such a compassed and kembo cast, that part of it may light on the East side, on which he stands, and part of it on the North side.

But where the Law doth give the rules for <hi>sin offerings,</hi> it nameth not any particular offence, but only this generall, that they were to be presented, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ignorant offending against a negative command, and therefore to reduce them to particulars, it was most perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to allot them to that ignorant offending, which if it had proved wilfulnesse, had made the sorest breach betwixt God and Man; the reconciling of whom was the end of Sacrifice.

                     </note> The manner of offering these meat offerings was thus: He brought it in a silver or golden dish, in which it was ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and puts it into one of the holy vessels of the service, and hallowes it in the holy vessell, and puts the oil and the frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense upon it; then goes &amp; he brings it up to the South-east horn of the Altar, standing on the South side of the horn.

                  <p>The meat offering that was offered with the dayly sacrifice, had also a drink offering presented with it, and so had divers other sacrifices the like, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. Now the drink offering was only such a quantity of wine, more or lesse, according to the sacrifice as is there prescribed; which was neither mingled,<note n="[i]" place="margin">R.

                     </note> nor any of it powred into the fire as the meat offering was, but it was powred upon the foundation of the Altar as the blood was; and when the wine of the dayly meat offering was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, the song of the Temple began, as wee have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>There was a meat offering offered every morning with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he morning sacrifice, and yet it is observable, that the time of the evening sacrifice only is called <hi>Minchah</hi> (which was the title of the meat offering) and the time of the morning sacrifice not so, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.29. And again the time of the sacrifice is called by the name of the <hi>meat offering,</hi> rather then by the name of the <hi>sacrifice</hi> it self, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.21. the reason of which is somewhat hard to give, and almost as hard to find any that have given any guesse at it; whether the former were not because the private meat offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, or those of particular persons were most commonly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the afternoon: or whether it were not because the incense of the evening, was offered at the time of the meat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which at the morning sacrifice it was not: and whether the latter were not, because of the variety of materialls in the meat offering, which was not in the sacrifice it self, or
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:178179:54"/> because the sacrifice was not compleat till the meat offering came on, be it referred to the learned to judge.</p>
                  <p>And thus have we a brief account of the nature and manner of their sacrifices: (for as for the offering of their firstlings and their tenths, they were not so different from those mentioned, that they need a discourse by themselves, and about the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>challs we shall speak anon.) There are only two things more concerning their sacrifices to be inquired after, and they are these. First, how these sacrifices of sin and trespasse offerings, and burnt offerings became paid, (as wee have seen how they became due.) For it may be the offender had no mind to be at such charges though he knew he did owe a sacrifice upon such a sin, and trespasse: but he would spare the cost of a lamb, or goat, and would think it better saved then spent, if he could come fairly off, and keep his money. The provision in this case was twofold, <hi>conscience</hi> and <hi>penalty,</hi> and if the first prevailed not, the second took place, if the offence were known. Those that had any conscience, or regard of Religion, or of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, needed no other instigation to bring their offering, when they knew they were under an offence that called for it, but their conscience, and that regard: And they had a double motive to urge them to it; first, the obedience to Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which called for it; and secondly, the expiation of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r sin, which they beleeved was obtained by the offering: But if the party were not swayed by conscience or Religion, but had rather, and was readier to save his money, then either regard Gods command or his own expiation, if there were witnesse found that came forth and said that he had committed such a fin or trespasse, it was best for him then to think of setting apart an offering, or else he was in danger of a penalty, as he lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der guilt: Had hee committed sin ignorantly against any of those negative precepts, the transgressing against which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, had brought him under the danger of <hi>Cutting off;</hi> and now, when he comes to know that he had done amisse, hee refuseth to bring that sacrifice, that was due for such an offence, this contempt and refusall heightned the offence, so that now it appeared a wilfull sin, when he refuseth to seek his peace for
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:178179:54"/> it as for one of ignorance; and if he were called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, and witness produced of what he had done, and he convented, he must either cleer himself of the action, or<note n="[k]" place="margin">R. Sol. in <hi>Levit. 1.</hi>
                     </note> be challenged his offering; compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.4. But as farre as this matter rested upon their own devotion, (and where there was true devotion, it needed no further promoter,) the nation was so zealous of their rites, and the sins that deserved <hi>cutting off,</hi> were brought into so little compasse, and so plain, that not very obvious to be stumbled against through ignorance, that the failing to the render of these sacrifices when they became due, was indifferently well prevented, by one or other of these things, either their zeal, or this plainnesse, especially this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring that the people held, that <hi>ex opere operato</hi> these made their peace: The letter of the Law was, that <hi>he should offer of his own voluntary will, Lev.</hi> 1.4. And yet saith <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place. <hi>It teacheth that they urged him,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>it may be whether he would or no. But the text saith, He must do it of his own freewill. How then? They urged him till hee said I am willing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A second scruple about these sacrifices is, concerning the time of their presenting and offering. A man that lived at a great distance from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was faln under such an offence as that a sacrifice was due from him: what must hee do? Must he away presently thither to offer his offering? Must hee neglect his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments at home, and travail up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at a charge double and treble, and more to the charge of the sacrifice that he was to offer, and lay all things aside till that be done? The Provision in this case was, That he that became liable to any offering, might stay the paying of it till the next solemn festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of the three came, when all must appear before the Lord at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And so his pains, and cost of going up thither did accrew upon that generall and comprehensive command for their appearance, and not from his own private and particular occasion: They make this, one of the two hundred eight and forty affirmative precepts, that they pick up in the Law, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note>There were three fires continually made upon the altar: the first was the great fire which was made for the burning of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:178179:57"/> sacrifices. A second lesse then it was made upon the side of it, from which they took coals to carry into the holy place to burn the incense. And a third was made for no other use, but to keep the fire in, that it might burn continually, and not go out: And they give their reason for this number of fires, which I shall not insist upon: Now he that was to dresse the Altar of its ashes first, he takes a silver chafing dish which usually stood on the West side of the Altar, and going to the Altar top, hee scrapes the coals this way, and that way, and takes up his dish full of burnt coals, and comes down with them to the pavement, and when he comes there, he turns his face towards the North, and goes so along, till hee comes to the Eastside of the Altar-rise, and there he laies down the coales on a heap, hard by the rise, in a place where they also laid the garbage of the Birds, and the ashes that were cleansed off the golden Altar.</p>
                  <p>When his fellow Priests perceived that hee was come down from the Altar, they hasted and washed their hands and feet; and taking the shovells and hooks that were for that service, they turned the peeces of the last nights sacrifice, if any were yet left unburnt, to the sides of the Altar, and if the sides would not hold them, they laid them upon the Altar rise. Then do they scrape together the ashes from all the sides to the middle of the Altar, upon a great heap, and take from thence as much as filled a great vessell of halfe an Homer (this vessell was called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Pesachtar</hi>) and this they bring down with them, yet leaving a reasonable big heap of ashes still, which they call <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puahh.</hi> When they had brought this great vessell of ashes down, others of the Priests in lesser vessells carried them away, even out of the City: and laid them in a calm place, that the wind might scatter them as little as possible: and these ashes might not be put to any use.</p>
                  <p>This cleansing of the Altar every morning, they began most commonly about the dawning: but on the three solemn festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals they began much sooner, and on the day of Expiation, they began from midnight. When therefore they had thus brought off the ashes, they go about to make the fire: And first they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the great fire for the burnt sacrifices, which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>The great pile,</hi> and this they made
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:178179:57"/> something towards the East side of the Altar. The second fire which was for the coals for the incense, was made of the wood of figtree only, and that was made toward the Southwest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that place being neerest to the Priests standing upon the Altar rise, &amp; the coals there being the readiest to be taken away. As for the third fire, which was for the keeping of the fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burning, it was made indifferently in any part of the Altar: Now besides all the other wood which was laid on the great fire, they added two singular billets, (for which they produce singular tradition) to it, when the sacrifice came on; which at the morning sacrifice was carried and laid on by one Priest, but at the Evening sacrifice by two. Having thus made the fire, they lay the peeces of the last nights sacrifice that were not burnt, upon it again; and so they come down, and return into the room <hi>Gazith</hi> again; and there the President calls them to a lottery again.</p>
                  <p>There were thirteen particular services more to bee assigned to particular men; as killing the sacrifice, sprinkling the blood, cleansing the golden Altar, dressing the lamps, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the parts of the sacrifice to the rise of the Altar, &amp;c. The first of which was appointed by lot in the same manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the rest fell in order to the persons, as they stood in order beyond him: they therefore conclude again upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther summe or number, hold up their fingers, and hee counts again. The man at whose fingers the count is up, 1. Hee is appointed to kill the sacrifice. 2. Hee that stands next beyond him must take and sprinkle the blood. 3. The next beyond him must cleanse the incense Altar. 4. The next beyond must dresse the candlestick and lamps. 5. The next must bring the head and legs of the sacrifice to the rise of the Altar. 6. The next must bring his two shoulders. 7. The next, the rump and the feet. 8. The next, the breast, weasand and plucks. 9. The next, the two loins. 10. The next, the inwards. 11. The next, the meat offering. 12. The next, the High-priests meat offering. 13. And the next, the drink offering. And thus these thirteen severall imployments were distributed severally to thirteen men, the first by the lottery, and all the rest by the mens standing, and this was the second lot.</p>

                  <p>There were two lots for two services more used, namely for the burning of the incense, and for the bringing of the peeces of the sacrifice from the rise of the Altar, to the Altar top, and laying them on, but those two lots were not cast till a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the day, then the time that we are now upon.

                  <p>Those who were missed, and were not either by the lot, or by their standing appointed to any of these imployments, that are mentioned, they put off their Priests garments, all but their linnen breeches, and went about the more servile works; as to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He that was alotted to kill the Lamb, and had fetched him out of the <hi>Lamb room,</hi> brought him to <hi>the place of the rings,</hi> where the sacrifice was usually slain; and the rest that were to sprinkle the blood, and to carry the parts to the Altar, goe with him thither, and wait for their imployment till it come: others go into the room where the vessells of the service lay, and from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:178179:58"/> thence they bring ninety three silver and gold vessells, which were all to be used that day; in one of them they give the Lamb water to drink, for that, they thought made him to flea the better.</p>

                  <p>As soon as the noyse of the opening of the Temple doore was heard, he that was to slay the sacrifice slew him: and as neer as might be, he that cleansed the incense Altar, cleansed it while the sacrifice was in slaying. And when they sprinkled the blood, he that was to dresse the lamps, dressed some of them at the time of sprinkling.</p>
                  <p>The manner of clensing the incense Altar was thus. He took the golden dish <hi>Teni,</hi> and set it before the Altar, and took his handfull of coals and ashes of the Altar, put them into it, and brushed the rest into it; left it standing there, and so came out.</p>
                  <p>The dressing of the lamps was in this manner. There was a great stone that lay before the Candlestick, in which there were hewed three steps; whereby, he that was to dresse the lamps, stepped up. What lamps were out, he took out the yarn and oil, and put in new, and lighted them at some of the lamps that were not out. Only that which they called <hi>the western lamp,</hi> if that were out, it must not bee lighted but by some fire fetched from the sacrifice Altar.</p>

                  <p>As for those lamps that hee found burning, he snuft them,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:178179:59"/> drest them, and supplyed them with new oil. And thus hee did only by five lamps at this time, for hee dressed not all the seven at once: and having thus done, he sets down his golden dish <hi>Coz,</hi> on the second step on which he had gone up, and so he came out.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while they without were sprinkling the blood, flaying the sacrifice, and dividing it into its peeces: which so divided, the severall men, appointed to carry the peeces to the rise of the Altar, brought them thither, salted them, and left them there, and now again goe into the room <hi>Gazith,</hi> which was as their Chappell, to their prayers.</p>

                  <p>Thus was the ordinary and common service of the Temple morning and evening, save that at the evening service there was some small difference from this rubrick, which was not very materiall: as that then they cast not lots for their severall imployments, but those that the lot had assigned them in the morning, they retained in the afternoone: onely about the matter of burning the incense they cast lots anew amongst those of the house of the father that served that day, that had never burnt incense in their lives: but if all of them had at one time or other been upon that imployment, then he that had had it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:178179:62"/> by lot at the morning Service, did also performe it at the evening: likewise at the evening Sacrifice the burning of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conse was a little later then at the morning, as was toucht be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for it was not till after the laying on of pieces of the beast upon the Altar, and the offering of the drink offering: so that then the burning of incense and the publique prayers fell in just with the time of the <hi>Minchah</hi> or meat offering.

               <p>The two first witnesses that came, if their testimony were current did serve the turn, and they looked no further (yet had they something to say to all the couples that came, because they would encourage the work:) or if those two did not serve the turn, when any other two did, then they tooke course that all the Country might know of the day with what speed might bee.</p>
               <p>For that purpose their course at the first was this: At night (after they had concluded by day, by such witnesse, that the new moon was seen the night before) they caused one to goe upon mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> with a bundle of most combustible wood, and other stuffe, and there he set it on fire, and waved it up and down, and this way, and that way, and never left, till he saw another do so upon another hill, and so another on a third: and those that took at him, they waved their blazes up and down, till they were answered with the like from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hill, and so the intelligence was quickly dispersed through the whole land: Nay, saith the <hi>Talmud,</hi>
                  <note n="[e]" place="margin">Rosh. hash. ibid.</note>
                  <hi>it went from mount</hi> Olivet <hi>to</hi> Sartaba, <hi>from</hi> Sartaba <hi>to</hi> Gryphena, <hi>from</hi> Gry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phena <hi>to</hi> Hhevaron, <hi>from</hi> Hhevaron <hi>to</hi> Beth Baltin: <hi>and he that stood there never left waving his blaze, till he saw all the place of the captivity full of the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Country thus seeing these flames and blazes, knew that the new moon had appeared the night before, and that the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> had concluded the day past, for the first day of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:178179:66"/> month, and so they knew how to count forward: But it seems experience taught them in time, that by such kind of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, they might be, and sometimes were deceived <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> Therefore they fell to a second way of dispersing their intelligence, and that was by sending messengers up and down the Countrey for this purpose: What a toil would a good Almanack have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nay an indifferent one would have given as much, or more certainty about this matter, then this way did, or could doe, because of the slipperinesse of it in severall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>These messengers were sent abroad upon this errand onely seven months in the year: As,</p>

               <p n="2">2. In the month <hi>Ijar,</hi> because of the second Passeover, or the Passeover in the second month.</p>

               <p n="4">4. In the month <hi>Elul,</hi> because of the beginning of the year, the next month after: for <hi>Elul</hi> was most ordinarily <hi>mensis vacuus,</hi> or a month of nine &amp; twenty days only, and so they knowing the first day of <hi>Elul,</hi> they might observe the thirtieth day, for the first of <hi>Tisri,</hi> or the beginning of the year: And if on the thirtieth day they found not either by the sight of the moon, or by some intelligence from the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> that that proved the first day of the month; they kept the next day after also for it, that they might make sure.</p>

               <p>First therefore we will begin with the difference which the Jewish Doctors hold out, between the Passeover in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Passeover in succeeding ages, which<note n="[a]" place="margin">Tosaphta in Pessach. per. <hi>8.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Passeover in</hi> Egypt <hi>was not charged with sprinkling the blood and fat upon the Altar: but it is otherwise with the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in after times.</hi>

                  <p>THE next care they were to have in reference to the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, was to refraine from the eating and use of Leaven at Passeover time, and that at the time when the Passeover was slaine it should not be found within their houses.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:178179:70"/> dispatch, that they might follow their Passeover work the better.</p>
                  <p>It is in dispute in the place cited immediately before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning resting from labour on this day that we have in hand, and it proves a controversie betweene the schooles of <hi>Shammai</hi> and <hi>Hillel,</hi> whether they should not also rest from labour the night before: but at last the determination comes so low, as that it gives liberty to workes that were begun on the thirteenth day to be finished on the fourteenth; nay yet lower, that where the custome was to leave off work for all day, there they should leave off work; and where it was the custome to work till noon there they should do according to the custome.</p>
                  <p>But whatsoever they did in this case, cease from their labour in the forenoone or cease not, one worke they must not fail to do, and that was to cast out and put away leaven out of their houses, this day (as they had searched for it the night before) and that it might not be seen nor found amongst them.

                     <hi>A very hard expression</hi> (saith <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>) and he gives as very hard an interpretation of it; for he judgeth the two Evenings to be these, the one when the Sunne sets and goes out of fight, and the other when the day closes in and all the light is cleane gone, which he saith is ordinarily about an houre and three quarters after Sunne setting; and so he will have the dayly Sacrifice to be offered up at this time, and though all the Passeovers could not be killed in this space yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth that it is commanded they should be killed <hi>between the two Evenings,</hi> because most of them were slaine in this space though all could not. I shall not insist to shew the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this <hi>Tenet,</hi> he himselfe that holds it, is in a manner glad at last to betake himselfe to the generall and common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion, which was, that <hi>the two Evenings</hi> were these, the first from that time of the day that the Sunne began to decline from his verticall or noone-tide point toward the West, and the other from his going downe and out of sight. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this construction did they go in killing and offering up their Evening Sacrifice, taking up an houre for that businesse just in the middle of the afternoon (counting at Aequinox time) namely from halfe an houre past two, to halfe an houre past three, and so there were two houres and an halfe from the Suns beginning to decline to the time they killed, and two houres and an halfe from the time they offered it up, till the Sun went downe.</p>
                  <p>Now occasionall Sacrifices did sometimes cause an alteration of the time of the dayly, for that being to be ever offered the first as being the fixed and appointed service of the day, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might have roome to be offered up in due time, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:178179:72"/> out of its place, to somewhat earlyer in the day, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an hour, and sometimes two, as in the traditions alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and especially this was for the sake of the Passeover, when Lambs were exceeding many: The common time therefore to begin to kill the Passeover was, from about half an hour past two a clock, and little more, and so continued all afternoone: and if the Passeover lighted on the Eve of the Sabbath, (that is, on the day preceding the Sabbath) they began an hour sooner, that they might the better dispatch their businesses by the time that the Sabbath began.</p>

Now according to this manner of fitting and leaning, are we to construe that passage of the Evangelist, about the beloved Disciple's <hi>leaning in the bosome of Jesus, Joh.</hi> 13.23. and <hi>on the breast of Jesus, Joh.</hi> 13.28. &amp; 21.20. for so the words are clearly differenced, <gap reason="foreign">

Whereas the manner of their sitting together was only thus; <hi>Jesus</hi> leaning upon the table on his left elbow, and so turning his face and breast away from the table on one side; <hi>Iohn</hi> sate in the same posture next before him, with his backe towards <hi>Iesus</hi> breast or bosome; not so neare as that <hi>Iohns</hi> backe and <hi>Iesus</hi> breast did joine together and touch one another; but at such a distance as that there was space for <hi>Iesus</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:178179:77"/> to use his right hand upon the table to reach his meat at his pleasure, &amp; so for all the rest as they sate in the like manner. For it is but a strange fancy that some have satisfied themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all about this matter, conceiving either that they lay along upon the beds before the table one tumbling upon the breast or before the breast of another; or if they sate leaning on the table, that they sate so close, as that ones backe joined to anothers bosome, which did utterly deprive them of the use of their hands to feed themselves. But their sitting was so, as that indeed they sate the back of one to the breast of another, but with such distance between, that the right hand of every one of them had liberty to come and go betwixt himselfe and his fellow to reach his meat as he had occasion. In such a manner and distance did the beloved Disciple leane before our Saviour, and yet is said very properly to leane in his bosome, because he leaned before his breast, so as that whensoever <hi>Christ</hi> put up his arme he was in a manner within his embrace. But when <hi>Peter</hi> beckened to him to enquire who it was that should be the traitour, then <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Among the severall viands, or victuals, or concomitants, or what you will call them, which accompanied the Paschal Lamb at its eating, of which wee shall speake in their course, there were two which they held to be most eminent, and most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; and those were <hi>Bread and Wine:</hi> And amongst other expressions of respect and honour that they shewed to these, this was not a small one, that howsoever they disposed of their

               <p>And now to take up the whole rubrick of this Sacramentall Supper in a short summe, they sate them downe in a leaning posture, began with a cup of wine, over which they hallowed the day; washed their hands; the table is furnished, they first eat some sallet, have a second cup of wine filled, over which is the rehearsall of the <hi>Haggadah,</hi> and of <hi>Psal.</hi> 113, 114. and then the wine drunke off. They wash their hands againe, unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bread is broken and blessed, and some of it eaten with bitter herbs dipt in the thicke sawce; then eat they the flesh of the peace offerings, and then the flesh of the Lamb; after which they wash; have a third cup of wine filled, or the <hi>cup of blessing,</hi> over which they first say grace after meat, and then give thankes for the wine and so drinke it off.

               <p>Thus was the Rubrick and Rituall of this great solemne Supper, with which the Reader comparing the action of our Saviour at his last Passeover, he will easily perceive, that the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first thing he did, is coincident with the third cup or the <hi>cup of blessing,</hi> which he biddeth them to <hi>divide among themselves;</hi> And then he taketh some of the unleavened bread againe, and blesseth, and breaketh, and giveth to be eaten for his body, from henceforth, in that sense that the flesh of the Paschall Lamb which they had newly eaten had been his body hitherto: And that which was commonly called the <hi>cup of the Hallel,</hi> he taketh and ordaineth for the cup of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his blood, and after it they sung the <hi>Hymne</hi> or the <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel</hi> out, and so he went out into the Mount of Olives.</p>

                     </note> On this day all the males were to appear in the Court of the Temple, and to bring with them a burnt offering for their appearance, and a double peace offering, one for the solemnity, and another for the joy of the time. The offering for their appearance was called <hi>Corban Ranjah,</hi> &amp; they conclude it due from these words, <hi>None of you shall appear before me empty, Exod.</hi> 23.15. Yet if any one failed of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a gift, his shame and his conscience goe with it, but there was no penalty upon him, because though he had broken a Negative Precept, yet there was no worke nor action done by him in it.</p>
                  <p>The peace offerings for the solemnity of the time were called the <hi>Hagigah,</hi> and they were to be of some beast, Bullocke or Sheep. Hereupon in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.24. &amp; 35.7, 8. there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Bullocks and Oxen for the Passeover;</hi> and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.2. there is speech of <hi>sacrificing the Passeover of the heard;</hi> which cannot be understood of the Passeover that was to be eaten on the fourteenth day at Even, for that was punctually, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately appointed to be of Lambs or Kids, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.5. but it is to be construed of these peace offerings which were for the solemnity of the time. And this is that which the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist <hi>John</hi> calleth the <hi>Passeover,</hi> when he saith, <hi>The Jewes went not into Pilates judgement Hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passeover, Joh.</hi> 18.28.

                  <p>They held themselves obliged by the Law, as to appear at the three solemne festivals, and to pay their offerings and their services then due, so to make merry and to rejoyce, and cheere up one another, because it is said, <hi>Thou shalt rejoyce before the Lord, Deut.</hi> 16.11, 14, &amp;c.

                     <hi>The peace offerings of rejoycing.</hi> And by the offering of these two sorts of peace offerings, it is like they thought themselves the better discharged though they brought not the offering of their appearance; for if they brought these, they might the better thinke they appeared not empty. And so <hi>Levi Gershom</hi> constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that passage concerning <hi>Elkanah,</hi> that <hi>he went up yearly from his City to Shiloh to sacrifice to the Lord,</hi> in application to these sorts of peace offerings, rather then any other offering, <hi>for it meaneth</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The time for the offering of these they accounted the first day of the festivall to be most proper, and they strove to dispatch upon it that they might returne home the sooner, but if these Sacrifices were offered in any day of the festivall, it served the turne.</p>
                  <p>On this first day of the feast, when these great matters were to be in hand, namely their appearing in the Court and offering these their Sacrifices of solemnity and rejoicing at the last Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of our Saviour, they shewed themselves otherwise imployed, for on this day they crucified the Lord of life.</p>

                  <p>On this day that we have in hand, namely, the second day of the Passeover week, whatsoever else of extraordinary offering was on it, there never failed to be the offering and waving of the first fruit sheafe before the Lord: The Law for this is given in <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.10, 11. <hi>When ye be come into the Land which I give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and shall reap the Harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheafe of the first fruits of your harvest unto the Priest; and he shall wave the

                  <p>The rites about gathering and offering this first fruits sheaf are largely described by <hi>Tosaphta ad Menachoth</hi> to be after this manner<note n="[a]" place="margin">Tosaphta ad Menachoth. per. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note>: <hi>Rabbi Ismael saith, The Omer or first</hi> fruits sheaf, <hi>if it came on the Sabbath day,</hi> (properly so called, as it did that very day that our Saviour rested in the grave) <hi>it came in three Seahs, but if on another day it came in five:</hi> but the <hi>wise men say, whether Sabbath or other day all was one, it came in three Seahs:</hi> Aba Saul <hi>said, On the Sabbath it was reaped by one man, and with one sickle, and in one basket: but on another day it was reaped by three men and in three baskets, and with three sickles: But the wise men said, Sabbath or other day it was all one, it was by three men, and in three baskets, and with three sickles: The first fruits sheaf came out of the vale of the ashes by the Brook</hi> Kidron, <hi>&amp;c. The day of waving it lighting on the Sabbath, the Sabbath was dispensed with for the reaping of it: And how was it done? Those that the</hi> Sanhedrin <hi>sent about it, went out, at the Evening of the holy day,</hi> (the first day of the Passeover weeke) <hi>they took baskets and sickles, &amp;c. They went out on the holy day when it began to be dark, and a great company went out with them: when it was now dark one said to them, On this Sabbath, on this Sabbath, on this Sabbath; In this basket, in this basket, in this basket;</hi> R. Eliezer, <hi>the son of</hi> Zadok <hi>saith, With this sickle, with this sickle, with this sickle, every particular three times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And they answer him, well, well, well, I will reap, and he bids them reap. And why do they thus? Because of the</hi> Barthusaeans (the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers) <hi>who said that the reaping of the first fruit sheaf is not on the end of the holy day. They reap it, and put it into the baskets, and bring it into the Court: and passe it through the fire: that they might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the command about parched corn. The words of</hi> Rabbi Meir, <hi>But the wise men say, That is not to be meant so, but there was a hollow vessell full of holes, so that the fire might go quite through it in the Court, and the wind blew on it,</hi> (in which they put the Corn sodainly

                  <p>FRom this day and occasion, namely from the offering of the first fruits <hi>Omer</hi> they began to count the weekes to <hi>Pentecost,</hi> even seven weeks forward. This day was the first of the number, and the next day after the expiring of seven weeks, being the fiftieth day from hence, was <hi>Pentecost</hi> day, as is imported in the very word. It was dated from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the first Corn, because that solemnity and this festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall had some relation one to another: The presenting of the first sheaf, was an introduction to harvest, and the feast of Pentecost was a return or offering of their harvest: by that they had liberty to begin to put the sickle into the corn and to reap: and at this they offered an offering of their Corn now reaped and inned. Therefore this solemnity is sometimes called in Scripture <hi>the Feast of Harvest, Exod.</hi> 23.16. and sometimes <hi>the feast of weekes, Deut.</hi> 16.10. because of the reckoning of the seven weekes from that day to it, and sometimes <hi>Pentecost, Act.</hi> 2.1. because it was the fiftieth day from that: and so the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves call it <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now these Lambes being <hi>Peace offerings</hi> were to be waved up and down with the two cakes, for so is the command ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.20. and the manner of that action was thus:<note n="[i]" place="margin">Maym. ubi supr.</note> The Priest first waved the Lambs up and down whilest they were yet alive, and then slew them: and having fleaed them, he took out the breast and shoulder of either of them, and laid them close besides the two cakes, and putting his hand under them he waved them all together, upwards and downwards, and this way and that way, and all towards the East; and afterwards burnt their inwards, and the Priest ate the rest of the flesh.

                  </note> lest his wife proving to be in her separation, should bring upon him an uncleannesse of seven dayes, and so prevent him of being fit for that dayes services.</p>
               <p>They also appointed another Priest as his substitute, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the service of that day, if it should fall out, that any uncleannesse did befall him that he could not officiate, that so the service should not fall to the ground.</p>
               <p>Every day of these seven, they caused him to sprinkle the bloud of the dayly Sacrifice, to burn the parts of it, to offer the incense and dresse the Lampes, that hee might be the better inured to those Services on that day when it came.</p>
               <p>On the third day and on the seventh, they besprinkled him with the ashes of the red Cow, for fear he might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by the dead, and not aware of it.</p>
               <p>They delivered to him some of the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> who read before him the rubrick and order of that dayes service, and they said unto him, <hi>Sir High-Priest, read thou thy self, it may bee thou hast forgotten, or it may be thou hast not learned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Eve of the day of expiation, that is, on the day
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:178179:90"/> before in the morning they brought him to the East-gate of the Courts, and there they made Bullocks, and Rams, and Lambs to passe before him, that still he be the better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with every thing that he had to do.</p>
               <p>Afterward the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> delivered him over to the Elders of the Priesthood; who brought him into the chamber of <hi>Abhtenes,</hi> that there he might learn to hand the incense: And there they gave him this oath: <hi>Sir High-Priest we are the Messengers of the</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>and thou art our Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the</hi> Sanhedrins, <hi>wee adjure thee by him that hath caused his name to dwell in this House that thou alter not any thing of what we have spoken to thee:</hi> and so they part weeping.</p>
               <p>Now the reason of this solemn adjuration was because of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who had vented a doctrine, and some of them had ventured a practise contrary to the tradition of the Elders, namely to kindle the incense, and to make it smoke without the vaile, and to bring it smoking within: <hi>They swore him,</hi> saith<note n="[c]" place="margin">Talm.

                  </note> the Jerusalem Talmud, <hi>because of the</hi> Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusaeans, <hi>who said, Let him kindle the incense without, and then bring it in: And there was one that did so, and when he came out, one said to his Father: Ye have been searching all your dayes, yet did ye never the thing to purpose till this man came and did it, he answered him: although we have been searching all our dayes, yet have we done according to the will of the wise men. And I shal much wonder if this man that hath done so, live long after. And they say he died shortly:</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within three dayes.</p>
               <p>The Even being come, they suffered him to eat but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, because fulnesse would make him drousie: for sleep he might not for fear of nocturnall pollution, but all the night, he, if he were learned, read and expounded the Scripture to them that were with him, if he were not learned, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, especially out of<note n="[d]" place="margin">Vid. gloss. in Ioma in Talm Babyl. per. <hi>1.</hi>

                  </note> as that to eat any thing, or to doe any work on it, fell under the penalty of <hi>being cut off</hi>) the High-Priest is now to

(which stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Temple and the Altar) laid his two hands upon his head, and made this confession: <hi>Ah Lord, I have sinned, done perversly and transgressed before thee, I and mine house, I beseech thee O Lord expiate the sins, perversities and transgressions, whereby I have sinned, done perversly and transgressed, I and mine house, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>thy servant saying, for on this day hee will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate for you to purge you from all your sins before the Lord that ye may bee clean.</hi>

                  </gap> The two goates were set before him: one before the right hand and the other at the left: and on his right hand stood the <hi>Sagan,</hi> and on his left hand stood chief of his Fathers house: He put his hand in the box and took out the lots: and opening his hands if the lot for the Scape-goat came in his right hand the <hi>Sagan</hi> said to him, <hi>Sir, lift up your right hand,</hi> and so the right hand Goat was the Scape-goat: And if that lot came in his left hand, the chief of his Fathers house said
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:178179:91"/> to him, <hi>Sir, lift up your hand,</hi> and then that was the Scape-goat that was on the left hand: And he tied a scarlet list up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Goats head, and set him there from whence he was to be sent away, and the other Goat he set where he must be killed.</p>
               <p>This scarlet list is called commonly by the Rabbins <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> in the time of <hi>Simeon the just,</hi> and that the lot for the Scape-goat came still up in his right hand: and this they ground upon <hi>Esay</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p>Having thus set the two Goats ready against their time comes, he returned again to his own Bullock where he left him standing, and layes his hand upon his head a second time, and makes a second confession, in the very same words that he had done the former, save that when he had said, <hi>wherein I have sinned, done perversly, and transgressed before thee, I and my fathers house,</hi> he added, <hi>and the sons of</hi> Aaron <hi>thy holy people, as it is written in the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then killed he the Bullock, took the bloud and gave it one to stir that it should not congeal: He himself took a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser full of coals from the Altar, and set them down upon a bench in the Court: and from a vessell brought him, he took his hands full of incense and put it into a dish: The censer of coals he took in his right hand (because it was hot and heavy, otherwise he should have carried it in his left) and the dish of incense in his left hand, and so he went into the Holy of Holies, and came up to the Ark, and there he sets his coals down, empties the incense into his hands again, and so lay it on the coals, and stayes till all the room be full of smoak, and then comes backward out from within the vail, having his face still toward the Ark: Being come out he made this short prayer, <hi>O Lord God let it be thy good pleasure, that this year may have seasonable rains,</hi> (if it have been droughty): <hi>And let not thy Scepter depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>and let not thy people</hi> Israel <hi>want suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and let not the prayer of wicked transgressors come before thee:</hi> and so he came out.</p>

               <p>Then tooke he the bloud of the Bullock which had been stirred about all this while, for congealing; and brought it in within the most holy place, and sprinkled of it eight times, once upward and seven times downward between the barres of the Arke, and having so done he came out thence, set the rest of the bloud in the bason in the Holy place and came forth.</p>
               <p>Then slew he the Goat, tooke the blood of it into the most holy place, and sprinkled it there eight times, as the other; came forth and set it downe in the holy place, tooke up the Bullocks blood and sprinkled it eig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Between <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and this hill there were ten Booths set up at an equall distance one from another, namely, about a mile asunder, and the neerest about a mile from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:178179:92"/> Having delivered the Goat to him that was to bring him into the Wildernesse, they accompanied him to the first Booth, and from thence there were some ready there to accompany him to the next, and some at that to goe with him to the third, and thus through all: and at every Booth they asked the man that led him whether he would eat or drinke.</p>
               <p>From the last Booth they went not quite through with him to the high Rocke, but stood at distance to see what hee did. When he came there, he tooke the crimson list from between the Goats hornes and pulled it in two pieces; the one halfe of it he tyed upon the rocke, and the other halfe upon his hornes againe. Then tooke he the Goat and pushed him backward from off the rocke, and by the time he came to the bottome he was dash'd all in pieces. And so the man returnes to the next Booth, and there staies till it be darke.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the High-priest after the sending away of the Goat, had returned to the service again, and cut in pieces the bullock and goat that he had slaine, and whose bloud he had brought within the vaile, and laid their inwards upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar to be burnt, but their pieces hee delivereth to some, to bee carried forth without <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> there to be burnt, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 16.27.</p>
               <p>At last they say to the High-priest, <hi>Sir, by this time the Goat is gotten into the Wildernesse.</hi> And then he went into the Court of the women, and there in a Pulpit read a Section or two in the Law, as namely, all <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. &amp; <hi>chapter</hi> 23. <hi>vers.</hi> 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>Now if it be questioned how they could guesse the very time when the Goat arrived in the Wildernesse, there are three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wayes of this conjecture held out by them, and they are these, 1 The <hi>Mishueh</hi> of the <hi>Talmud</hi> saith, there were severall high piles or pillars of stone set up in the way thither, and men stood upon them with linnen cloaths in their hands, and when the Goat was got into the Wildernesse, he that stood on the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar there, waved his Napkin up and downe, and the next tooke at him and did the like, and the next at him, and so they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the intelligence into the City in a trice. 2. <hi>R.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:178179:92"/> as ever the Goat arrived in the Wildernesse, it grew white.</p>
               <p>And that passage in the <hi>Gemara</hi> of the <hi>Babylon Talmud</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable (whether it speake of this list, or of that betwixt the Goats horns it is not much materiall, they were both of the same nature, and reference) when it saith<note n="[o]" place="margin">Rosh.

                  <hi>That all the forty years before the destruction of Jerusalem the red list did never turne white:</hi> for whereas this change of it was a signe of the remission of their sinnes, as they themselves construe it from <hi>Esay</hi> 1.18. they had now so died themselves with the bloud of Christ, slain just forty years before the destruction of the City, that we may wel take their owne evidence and testimony for their guilt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonablenesse for that fact. 3. <hi>R.

                  <hi>Beth Haduda,</hi> which was the edge of the Wildernesse that way that the Goat went, and for the measur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the space of time that the man might bee going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Goat, some men walked out a miles space from the City, and walked backe that mile againe without any stay, and when they were come backe, they stayed so much time as one might walke another mile, and then concluded that by that time the man with the Goate was come into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>The High-priest having read his lessons in the law, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eight severall prayers after, hee washes his hands and feet, puts off his linnen cloathes, baths himselfe, puts on his rich garments, washes his hands and feet againe; offereth a Ram for himselfe, and another for the people, and seven Lambs for the additionall offering of the day. And then he offered the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evening Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>This done he washed his hands and feet againe, put off his rich garments, bathed himselfe, and put on the linnen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, washed his hands and feet, went into the most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place and fetched out the censer and dish that he had left there.</p>
               <p>After this he washed his hands and feet, put off those linnen cloathes, bathed himselfe in water, put on his rich garments againe, washed his hands and feet, went into the Holy place, offered the Evening incense, mended the Lamps, and so came out.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:178179:93"/>
               <p>Then washed he his hands and feet againe, put off his rich garments and put on his owne ordinary wearing cloathes, and went to his house, all the people accompanying him: and he held it a joyfull day because he was come out of the most Holy place in safety.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE day of expiation was not so solemn, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and painefull, especially to the High-priest, but the <hi>feast of Tabernacles</hi> was as jocund, pleasant and mirthfull to all the people. It was but five dayes after that, beginning on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the same month <hi>Tisri,</hi> and lasting eight dayes together, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.34, 35, 36. <hi>Numb.</hi> 29.12, 35. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.17, 18. In which feast there was more rejoycing then in any of the other, and more parcels and varieties of solemnity.</p>
               <p>The first particular of its solemnity and celebration was their dwelling in booths, (from which custome the feast tooke its name) which they began to do on the first day of the feast, and so continued all the time, and out of those booths they might neither eat, nor drinke, nor sleep, so long as the feast lasted. Their Booths were of boughs of trees, in the making of which, for height, and breadth, and place, and fashion, it were endlesse to trace their curiosity and traditions, and it is somewhat excentricke to our discourse which is confined to the virge of the Temple. Within which confinement we are to take up foure remarkable ingredients to the solemnity of this feast, and they are these.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Jerusalem Talmud</hi> doth give this briefe summary of the progresse of their proceedings in the service of the Temple every day of this feast.<note n="[a]" place="margin">Talm. Ier. in Succ. per. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>They went first to offer the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice in the morning; then the additionall Sacrifices; after that the vowes and free offerings; from thence to eat and drink</hi> (or to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) <hi>from thence to the study of the Law; and after that, to offer the Evening Sacrifice, and from thence they went to the joy of the powring out of the water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the constant or dayly Sacrifices of these dayes of the Feast were unalteredly the same that they were on all other dayes, a Lamb in the morning, and a Lamb at even: but the additionall Sacrifices for the time, were not onely remarkable for their number (they and the dayly Sacrifices of this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to 215. the number of the yeares of <hi>Israels</hi> being in <hi>Aegypt</hi>) but they were most remarkable for this alteration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Bullock lesse was offered every day then had been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the day before; and yet the very same number of Rams, Lambs, and Goats, retained every day alike: For on the first day of the Feast were thirteen Bullocks offered, on the second day twelve, on the third day eleven and so downward, as may be seen in <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. and yet on every day two Rams, fourteen Lambs, and one Goat, without any alteration, as is apparent in the same place.</p>
                  <p>The reason of which decrescency of the Bullocks, may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter guessed at, then surely given, and variety of conjecture sooner produced of others, then any certainty determined by our selves. Whether it were to reduce the whole number of the Bullocks to 70.<note n="[b]" place="margin">R. Sol. in <hi>Numb. 29.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>in parallel to the</hi> 70. <hi>Nations which should be abating and decaying, while Israel like the number of the Rammes, Lambs, and Goats, remained fixed:</hi>
                     <note n="[c]" place="margin">Abarb. ibid.</note> or according to the 70. years of mans age, which is daily decaying; or whether it were to shew the decay of Sacrifice in time to come; or to match 7
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:178179:94"/> Bullocks with the seventh day; or to reduce the number of Beasts on that day to an equality with the number of the four and twenty courses; or whether this abatement were because the people abated dayly, and withdrew to their owne homes; or what else was the cause of it, we shall not be sollicitous to enquire further after, onely we cannot but observe the manner of offering of these Sacrifices which were so numerous and so various, and the service with them.</p>
                  <p>The daily Sacrifice was offered according to the Rituall that hath been already observed by the Course appointed for that week, and according as every one obtained his imployment by the lottery. And at the offering of it the Levites sung the <hi>Hallel,</hi> of which mention and description hath beene made before.</p>
                  <p>But as for additionall Sacrifices, they found a way that every Course of the foure and twenty, who were now all present, should have a share in offering of one beast or other, and they proportionated the businesse after this manner.</p>

                  <p>THE Ceremonies and customes used at this Feast, which have been mentioned already, were somewhat strange, but the strangest rite is yet behind, and that is their <hi>drawing and pouring out of water,</hi> and their great rejoycing for it, which pouring out of water was used every day of the Feast, and their rejoycing upon it, was so great, that in all this Feast, nay in all their Feasts throughout all the year, they had not the like. For the fuller view of which and of the whole festivity of this solemn time, having now shewn you the men in their festivall garbe, with their branches in the one hand, and their pomecitrons in the other, we will now take up in order, the severall and particular services and passages of every day as they did occur.</p>
                  <p>First, they came with thir branches and Pomecitrons in their hands to the morning dayly Sacrifice, and stood so attending while that was offered.<note n="[a]" place="margin">Tosaphta in Succah. per. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> And when the parts of this Sacrifice were laid on the Altar, then was there this pouring out of water upon the Altar, but mingled with wine, and the manner thus:<note n="[b]" place="margin">Talm. ibid. per. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> One of the Priests with a golden Tankard went to the Fountain or Pool of <hi>Siloam,</hi> and filled it there with water: He returned back again into the Court through that which was called <hi>the water gate,</hi> (which we have taken the survey of in its place): and when hee came there, the Trumpets sounded: Hee goeth up the rise of the Altar where stood two Basins, one with wine in it, and into the other hee put the water: and hee poures either the wine into the water or the water into the wine, and then poures them out by way of libation: which action whilest he was going about the people cried to him, <hi>Hold up thy hand:</hi> And the reason of this admonition was, because of that <hi>Baithusaean</hi> or <hi>Sadduce</hi> that we have newly mentioned, who when he was about this libation, and should have pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Wine clear from him, he poured it upon his own
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:178179:96"/> feet, and this caused the multitude to pelt him with their pomecitrons.</p>
                  <p>At the time of this Libation did the musick and the song begin, and<note n="[c]" place="margin">Talm. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus. in Succah. pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> that song which they sung all the dayes of the Feast, at the daily Sacrifice was the <hi>Hallel</hi> (which we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed before) <hi>that being renewed daily,</hi> (saith the <hi>Jerusalem Talmud), as their Lulabh</hi> or branches <hi>were renewed daily:</hi>

                  <p>After the service of the daily Sacrifice was done, then fell they to the offering of the additionall Sacrifices which have been mentioned of so many Bullocks, Rams, Lambs, and a Goat: at which service the Songs-men sang again some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and appointed part of a Psalm:

                  </p>
                  <p>When these additionall Sacrifices were also finished, the people departed home to dinner (having first sung their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna</hi> about the Altar, as hath been related, with their palms in their hands) unlesse there were any that had vowes or free-will offerings to offer, who stayed for that occasion. After dinner they went severally to the Divinity Schools or to the Study of the Law for a while; and when the time came, to the Evening Sacrifice, where the service was much answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what was in the morning.</p>
                  <p>Towards night they began the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note>They went into the Court of the women, and there the women placed themselves upon balcones round about the Court, and the men stood upon the ground. There were four candlesticks (or beacons rather I might call them) of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great bignesse, and mounted of an exceeding great height, overtopping and overlooking the wals of the Court, and of the mountain of the house at a great elevation: By every Candlestick (which stood on every side of the Court one) there was a ladder, by which four young men of the Priests, did severally goe up to the Candlesticks with plenty of oil and yarn, which was ravelled of the Priests old coats and girdles, and they set them a burning.</p>
                  <p>The Pipe of the Temple began to play, and many Levites with their instruments in great aboundance, standing upon the fifteen steps that went down out of the Court of <hi>Israel</hi> into the Court of the women, and whosoever of them and of the Priests was musicall either with instrument or with voice, joined his Musick: In the mean while the greatest Grandees of the people, as the members of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Synagogues, Doctors of the Schools, and those that were of the highest rank and repute for place and religion, fell a dancing, leaping, singing and capering, with torches in their hands, with all their skill and might, whilest the women and the common people looked on: and thus they spent the most part of the night. And the more they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:178179:97"/> themselves (like <hi>David</hi> before the Arke) in this activity, he more they thought they did commendably, and deserved praise.</p>
                  <p>At last, far in the night two Priests, standing in the Gate of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> do sound their Trumpets; and then they come down to the tenth step and they sound there again, they come down into the Court of the women, and there sound a third time, and so they goe sounding all along the Court till they come to the East-gate of it, and there they turn themselves and look back up toward the Temple, and they say thus, <hi>Our Fathers which were in this place, turned their backs upon the Temple of the Lord, and their faces towards the East, towards the Sun, but as for us, wee are towards him, and our eyes towards him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>At length wearinesse, sleepinesse, and satiety with their mirth, concludes the jollity till another night, and so they part, some to their own homes, and others stay the night out in their places still, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And now to come to search after the reason of this strange and extraordinary jucundity at this time, it were no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to shew some cause why they might be more merry at the Feast of Tabernacles then at other festivalls, namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had now inned and gathered all their fruits, and therefore this Feast is called <hi>The Feast of ingathering in the end of the year, Exod.</hi> 23.15, 16. But why they should take up so great joviality, upon the pouring out or drawing of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned, is somewhat strange to observe, and not easie to resolve.</p>

                     <hi>Maymony</hi> giveth this as the cause of the rejoycing, Because it was the rejoycing for the keeping of the Law, to which no joy can be comparable: And therefore saith he, <hi>The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, and every one that would, were not actors in this rejoycing,</hi> for they neither sang nor danced, <hi>but were onely spectators, but the actors were the great men of wisdome and Religion.</hi>

                     </gap>: <hi>Because of the drawing or pouring out of the Holy Ghost: according to what is said, With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation, Esay,</hi> 12.3.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever was the reason, this was the manner of their carriage at this Feast, and upon this occasion: the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which helpeth to illustrate that passage in <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37, 38. which seemeth plainly to allude to this custome. For our Saviour in the last and great day of this Feast, (as vers. 2.) when they had all the seven days kept this great mirthfulnesse in reference to the drawing and libation of water, out of the poole <hi>Siloam,</hi> (which by some of their own confession refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the pouring out of the Holy Ghost) <hi>he stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst let him come to mee and drink: he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on mee, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water: speaking this of the spirit, &amp;c.</hi> As if hee had said to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to them in more large expressions. Is it so much rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to you to draw water out of <hi>Siloam,</hi> and pour it out, which doth but typifie the pouring out of the Holy Ghost? I tell you I am hee that can give you living water, and on him that beleeveth in mee, shall the Holy Ghost be so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:178179:98"/> poured out, as if streams of living water were alway flowing out of his belly. And to confirm this his saying by a miracle, he doth presently after give sight to a man born blind, by sending him but to wash in the pool of <hi>Siloam, Joh.</hi> 9.7.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles day after day. Every day they came with their branches to the Temple, had the <hi>Hallel</hi> sung, drew water out of <hi>Siloam</hi> and poured it and wine upon the Altar, incompassed the Altar, and sung their <hi>Hosanna,</hi> and at night had the rejoycing for the drawing of the water. Onely there was this difference among the dayes: that on the night before the Sabbath that fell within the Feast, and on the night before the eight day, which was a holy day, they used not their dancing, singing, and rejoycing, but on the seventh day they went about the Altar seven times, missed their dancing that night, and on the eight day had the same solemnities, with the dayes before, ate their pomecitrons which they might not doe before; and at night had the great rejoycing in the Court of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and so concluded the Feast: And therefore this by the Evangelist is called not onely <hi>the last day,</hi> but also <hi>the great day of the Feast,</hi> both because it was a holy day, and because it was the conclusion.</p>

                     <hi>The Feast of Dedication</hi> of which there is mention, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.22. had its originall, from the regaining and restoring of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Altar and service from the hands of the <hi>Syrogrecian</hi> tyrants, who had defiled, spoiled, and ruined them. The institution of the Feast was by victorious <hi>Judas Maccabeus and his brethren and the whole Congregation,</hi> appointing it<note n="[c]" place="margin">1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 4.52.59.</note> from the five and twentieth day of the month <hi>Cisleu</hi> eight dayes forward: which fell about the former part of our <hi>December.</hi> The greatest owning of this Feast at the Temple in the service there was by singing over the <hi>Hallel</hi> every day of the eight, as hath been mentioned heretofore.<note n="[4]" place="margin">Maym. in Chanuchah per. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>[d]</hi> And the greatest Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of this Feast in all other places was, the lighting of Candles every Evening and setting them up at the doores of their houses to burn in the night: And to such supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this point did some grow in time, that they used to light up a candle for every one that was in their family. Nay some yet would goe so high, as to double that number every night: as if there were ten in his house, he lighted up ten candles the first night of the Feast, and twenty the second, and thirty the third, and so still increasing that on the eight night he lighted up eighty candles.</p>
                  <p>The reason of the celebration of this Feast in this manner, is given by the Author cited next above in the Margin, in these words:<note n="[e]" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>
                     <hi>When Israel prevailed against their enemies, and destroyed them, it was the five and twentieth day of, the month Cisleu, and they went into the Temple, and found not there any pure oil, but onely one bottle: And there was no more oil in it, then to keep the Lamps burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for one day onely: yet, did they light them with it:</hi>
                     <note n="[f]" place="margin">Gloss. ibid.</note> And a miracle was <hi>shewed there withall</hi> (saith his glossary there) <hi>for it maintained the Lampes burning eight nights: whereupon the wisemen of that generation, did on the next year appoint these eight dayes for dayes of rejoycing and praise and for lighting up of candles at the doores of their houses.</hi>

                  <p>THe Law about burning a red Cow to ashes, and the use of those ashes for the purifying of those that were unclean by the dead, is given and described at large in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. and the significancy of that rite and other sprinklings is touched upon <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. The manner of their going about and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this great businesse (for so it was not unjustly held, because it was for the clensing from the greatest uncleannesse) was exceeding curious, and their circumspection about the matter was so nice and great, that in none of the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>When the day of her burning came, the Priest that was to doe it, and they that were to accompany him in that work,<note n="[c]" place="margin">Middoth. per. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> marched out at the East-gate of the mountain of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which gate was also called <hi>Shushan,</hi> and went over the valley of <hi>Cidron,</hi> to mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> to a pitch of the Kill just over against the Gate where they had come out, and in the face of the Temple:<note n="[d]" place="margin">Mayn in Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah. per. <hi>3.</hi> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalim. per <hi>4.</hi> &amp; Talm. in Parah. ubi supr.</note> All the way over the valley, was a causey made upon double arches, that is, one arch still stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon two arches, and so levelled on the surface as made a plain and even way all along: And the reason of this great cost and curiosity was, that all the way might be secure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst unseen or unknown graves (by which these passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers might have been defiled) the stone Arches not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to interre a corps. The like Arches for the like prevention, we have observed in its due place, were all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Courts of the Temple, and the like archednesse was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:178179:101"/> there on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> under the very place where the Cow was to be burnt, for the same security.</p>
                  <p>The Elders of the people marched before the Priest and his company all along this causey, to the place of the burning, and there when the Priest came up, they laid their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and called upon him to bath himself, for there was a place for that purpose, and so he did. Then was the pile made of wood in and on which shee was to bee burnt; and tying her legs with cords they lay her on, her head lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the South, and her face turning to the West: The Priest standing on the East side of her, and his face toward the West, kills her with his right hand, and takes the bloud with the left.</p>
                  <p>Now it was commanded by the Law, that the sprinkling of her bloud should be <hi>directly before the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation seven times. Numb.</hi> 19.4. For the answering of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the Priest having slain her, and taken her bloud, did sprinkle it so many times towards the Temple, looking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over the gate <hi>Shushan</hi> upon the porch of the Temple: the battlements of which gate were for this very purpose made lower then the battlements of any other of the Gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sanctuary; that over it he might see the face of the porch, which through it he could not reach to doe.</p>
                  <p>Having sprinkled her bloud, he sets his pile of wood a fire, and sets her a burning, and as shee was burning he takes ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar wood and hysop, and scarlet wool, and shews them and saith to the standers by, <hi>This is Cedar wood, this is Cedar wood, this is Cedar wood,</hi> three times over, and they answer him three times over, <hi>well, well, well:</hi> so likewise he saith, <hi>This is Hysop, this is Hysop, this is Hy op, This is Scarlet wool, this is Scarlet wool, this is Scarlet wool,</hi> and they answer him as before, three times to either of them, and then he casts those things into the fire, and they burn all together.</p>
                  <p>When all was burnt, they took up the ashes, and pounded and sifted them, and one part of them they laid up in some place of Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> for the sprinkling of the people: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part was delivered to the four and twentie courses for the sprinkling of the Priests, and a third part was laid
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:178179:101"/> up in the <hi>Chel</hi> or inclosure of the Courts to be kept for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall. Nine of these kine were burnt between the first giving of the Law about this Rite, and the fatall fall and destruction of the Temple. One in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> one burnt by <hi>Ezra,</hi> two by <hi>Simeon</hi> the just, two by <hi>Jochanan</hi>

                  <p>Now whereas the Law enjoined that for the cleansing of the uncleane, <hi>these ashes were to be sprinkled by a cleane person, Numb.</hi> 19.18. their Tradition straitned it to a person that had never been defiled by a dead corps in all his life; therefore that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons might be had, there were arches wrought in a rock in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> after the manner forementioned, and houses built over those arches. And thither, as to a place secure from graves, certaine women with child were brought when they were near the time of their delivery, and there they were brought to bed. And their children were there brought up continually for this very imployment, that they might be ready as they were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as there was occasion, to sprinkle these ashes. Which when any of them went to do, he rode on a seat on Oxens backs, first to the pool of <hi>Siloam,</hi> where he lighted in the water, (for there he might presume there was no grave to defile him) filled his pitcher, and got up againe, rode to Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> besprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled the party that was to be clensed, and rode in like manner to his Cell againe.</p>

Then denounced he the curse and wrote it in a booke, even those words, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>If no man hath lien with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncle annesse, &amp;c.
